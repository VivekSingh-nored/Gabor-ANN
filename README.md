using Gabor Feature Extraction and Support Vector Machine
----------------------------------------------------------------
This program is the clone of 'Face Detection System' in MATLAB
but instead of Neural Networks, It is based on Support Vector Machin (SVM)

    1- copy all files and directories to the MATLAB's work folder
     * In order to run the program you must have Image   Processing and Neural Networks Toolboxes

    2- find the file named "main.m"

    3- Double click on this file or type "main" in the command window

    4- a menu will be shown . click on  "Create SVM" and wait until the program is done with the training.

    5- click on "Test on Photos". A dialog box will be appeared. Select a .jpg photo
